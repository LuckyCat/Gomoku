Project Architecture
	I use Unreal Engine 4 standart class hierarchy and classes workflow. Because it will be flexible for future project extends. For example network support implementation, new moves etc.
	
	UGomokuControllerInterface 
		GomokuPlayerController - Player controller
		GomokuAIController - Implements gomoku AI strategy logic. Can be extended from C++ or Blueprints for custom implementations. Override OnReceiveControls.
		
	GomokuPawn - APawn Extendeble in blueprints. Controls visual representation of player moves
	GomokuBoard - Main AActor that implements all board mechanics
	GomokuMove - its an UObject that represent player move that applies to GomokuBoard. It can be extend in C++/Blueprints for game functionality extension. e.g. new moves like "black magic swap"
	
Additional Comments
	Used Instanced static meshes instead of bunch of single Static mesh because of huge performance increasing with this approach. 
	
UI/Keyboard/Mouse
